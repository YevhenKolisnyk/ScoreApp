# ScoreApp
Small app for updating score and team names for sport competition.
The app can be used by observers or judges on the field to update the team names and score.
The result is saved to a text file (path is configured in [app.cofig](/app.config)).
This file can be later syncronized via network and used as info-text in video stream (e.g in [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)) or on the text stream.

Made using c# and WPF.
